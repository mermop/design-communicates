      <h3 class="subhead">DESIGN COMMUNICATES</h3>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Design invariably serves the purpose of conveying messages, values, and expectations - whether as its primary function, as in graphic design, or as well as its function, as in industrial design. As with any communication, it always contains traces of its origins and intentions encoded within it.</p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">To design well is to communicate effectively and authentically. Good design harmonises embedded messages with intended messages, and considers the context it will be interpreted within. While a designer can never have complete control over the interpretation of a work, especially one that will be read by many people in many contexts, it is crucial to consider the likely effects of context on its interpreted message. Dissonance between explicit and implicit messages undermines authenticity. </p>
      <h3 class="subhead"><span class="black">DESIGN COMMUNICATES </span>CULTURE</h3>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Design elements are inherently culturally encoded and decoded. </p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Our own cultural context leads us to design with particular visual, textual and experiential shorthands and expectations. People then interpret based on their own cultural experiences, which may translate the same shorthands into something different.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="need">To design for resonance in specific groups, we should leverage cultural shorthands.</li>
        <li class="need">To design for many, we need to view how our designs will be interpreted through other peoples’ cultural experiences. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subhead"><span class="black">DESIGN COMMUNICATES </span>POWER</h3>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">To design is to manipulate the world around us. This is a type of power. Who gets to wield it, the degree of freedom they have, and the degree of influence the designs have, is reflective of power relationships.</p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Conway’s Law speaks of systems design reproducing the communication structure of its inception:</p>
      <p class="quote">organizations which design systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations<span class="red CharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-001-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-001">a</a></span></span></p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Similarly, design is also reflective of the power structures of organisations and societies. </p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Power relations are ubiquitous and complex, and their effect can be difficult to isolate. They include direct and indirect economic leverage, relationship intimacy and value, and the subtle and insidious intersections of gender, race, class, and other privileges. As Foucault tells us in the History of Sexuality, power relationships exist and operate within other types of relationships, and play a directly productive role in negotiation and decisionmaking<span class="red CharOverride-1"><span id="footnote-000-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="#footnote-000">b</a></span></span>.</p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">Design involves making a series of decisions. Design within any organisation involves a series of negotiations related to these decisions. Power relationships intimately affect these. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="need">To design responsibly, we need to be aware of the power structures we are part of.</li>
        <li class="need">To design authentically, we need to align the implicit messaging of power structures with the explicit messaging we intend to convey.</li>
        <li class="need">To design for a fairer world, we should work to balance power inequalities by including subaltern perspectives and needs in the design process.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subhead"><span class="black">DESIGN COMMUNICATES </span>VALUES</h3>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">We are often called to explicitly communicate values through design. Branding is an exercise in expressing ideas and values through visual patterns. </p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">If explicit messaging is at odds with implicit value projection, it calls into question all other stated values. Aspiring to a value that is implicitly contradicted undermines trust in other stated values. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="need">To communicate the values we want to through design, we must be consistent and thorough.</li>
        <li class="need">To design for trust, we must honestly face implicit value messages. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subhead"><span class="black">DESIGN COMMUNICATES </span>CONSTRAINTS</h3>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">The design process does not take place within a vacuum. We design to solve problems and address needs. We design for people, contexts, and materials. We design with the shortcomings of processes, humans, and organisations. We design for a job, within consumer capitalism, for clients, for technology with limitations.</p>
      <p class="Basic-Paragraph">There are always constraints, and they are encoded in the design whether intentionally or not. Clever designers can communicate them quietly and beautifully.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="need">To solve problems and address needs, we need to define our desired outcomes and problem spaces accurately. </li>
        <li class="need">To do our best work as designers, we need to face technical, human and financial constraints honestly, and design within these. </li>
      </ul>
