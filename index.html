        <p class="intro">
          Design invariably serves the purpose of conveying messages, values, and expectations - whether as its primary function, as in graphic design, or as well as its function, as in industrial design. As with any communication, it always contains traces of its origins and intentions encoded within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To design well is to communicate effectively and authentically. Good design harmonises embedded messages with intended messages, and considers the context it will be interpreted within. While a designer can never have complete control over the interpretation of a work, especially one that will be read by many people in many contexts, it is crucial to consider the likely effects of context on its interpreted message. Dissonance between explicit and implicit messages undermines authenticity.

        <p class="intro">
          <i class="yellow">To <span class="red">design</span> is to <span class="red">manipulate</span></i> the world around us. <i class="yellow">This is</i> a type of <i class="yellow"><span class="red">power</span></i>. Who gets to wield it, the degree of <span class="red">freedom</span> they have, and the degree of <span class="red">influence</span> the designs have, is reflective of <span class="red">power relationships</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="yellow"><span class="red">Economic power</span> determines</i> what gets <span class="red"><i class="yellow">design</i> expertise</span> spent on it. <span class="red">Clients</span> constrain the scope of design projects, or designers with the <span class="red">economic luxury of free time</span> define their own constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="yellow">Power relations are ubiquitous</i> and complex, and their effect can be <span class="red">difficult to isolate</span>. They range from <span class="red">overt</span> - the relationship between a junior designer and a senior designer - to <span class="red">subtle</span> - the effects of personal friendships and relationships when considering a designer's opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As <span class="yellow">Foucault</span> tells us in the <em>History of Sexuality</em>, <span class="yellow">power relationships exist and operate within other types of relationships</span>, and play a <span class="red">directly productive</span> role in <span class="red">negotiation</span> and <span class="red">decisionmaking</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="yellow">Design involves</i> making a series of <i class="yellow">decisions</i>. Design within any organisation involves a series of <span class="red">negotiations</span> related to these decisions. <span class="red">Power relationships</span> are <span class="red">intimately</span> involved here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="red">Conway's Law</span> speaks of systems design <span class="red">reproducing communication structures</span>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="yellow">organizations</span> which <span class="yellow">design</span> systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are <span class="yellow">copies of the communication structures</span> of these organizations
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Similarly, <i class="yellow">design output is reflective of the <span class="red">power structures</span> of <span class="red">organisations</span> and <span class="red">societies</span></i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i class="yellow">To design</i> at scale, to design as a practise, to design as a job, <i class="yellow">is to negotiate power relations</i> on an interpersonal and societal level. <i class="yellow">To design responsibly, we need to be aware of the power structures we are part of.</i>
