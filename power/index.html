    <p>
      To design is to manipulate the world around us. This is a type of power. Who gets to wield it, the degree of freedom they have, and the degree of influence the designs have, is reflective of power relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
        Economic power determines what gets design expertise spent on it; designers work within constraints defined by clients, or designers with the economic luxury of free time define their own constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Power relations are ubiquitous and complex, and their effect can be difficult to isolate. They range from overt - the relationship between a junior designer and a senior designer - to subtle - a hiring manager considering two candidates with similar qualifications and different genders or ethnicities.
    </p>
    <p>
        To design at scale, to design as a practise, to design as a job, is to negotiate power relations on an interpersonal and societal level. To design responsibly, we need to be aware of the power structures we are part of.
