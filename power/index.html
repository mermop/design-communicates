      <i class="yellow">To <span class="red">design</span> is to <span class="red">manipulate</span></i> the world around us. <i class="yellow">This is</i> a type of <i class="yellow"><span class="red">power</span></i>. Who gets to wield it, the degree of <span class="red">freedom</span> they have, and the degree of <span class="red">influence</span> the designs have, is reflective of <span class="red">power relationships</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i class="yellow"><span class="red">Economic power</span> determines</i> what gets <span class="red"><i class="yellow">design</i> expertise</span> spent on it. <span class="red">Clients</span> constrain the scope of <i class="yellow">design</i> projects, or designers with the <span class="red">economic luxury of free time</span> define their own constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i class="yellow">Power relations are ubiquitous</i> and complex, and their effect can be <span class="red">difficult to isolate</span>. They range from <span class="red">overt</span> - the relationship between a junior designer and a senior designer - to <span class="red">subtle</span> - the effects of personal friendships and relationships when considering a designer's opinion.

      As Foucault tells us in the History of Sexuality, <span class="yellow">power relationships exist and operate within other types of relationships</span>, and play a <span class="red">directly productive</span> role in <span class="red">negotiation</span> and <span class="red">decisionmaking</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i class="yellow">Design involves</i> making a series of <i class="yellow">decisions</i>. Design within any organisation involves a series of <span class="red">negotiations</span> related to these decisions. <span class="red">Power relationships</span> are <span class="red">intimately</span> involved here.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="red">Conway's Law</span> speaks of systems design <span class="red">reproducing communication structures</span>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="yellow">organizations</span> which <span class="yellow">design</span> systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are <span class="yellow">copies of the communication structures</span> of these organizations
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Similarly, <i class="yellow">design output is reflective of the <span class="red">power structures</span> of <span class="red">organisations</span> and <span class="red">societies</span></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i class="yellow">To design</i> at scale, to design as a practise, to design as a job, <i class="yellow">is to negotiate power relations</i> on an interpersonal and societal level. <i class="yellow">To design responsibly, we need to be aware of the power structures we are part of.</i>
